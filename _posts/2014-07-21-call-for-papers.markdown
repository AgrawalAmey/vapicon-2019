Vapicon 2019 will be held on 12th-13th of January in the city of Yavatmal. If you want to be part of this great event as a speaker you knocked at the good door.

#### Presenters â€“ who should speak at the Vapicon Conference?

* Doctors
* Researchers

If you belong to one of those groups you are cordially invited to submit a talk proposal (or a number of proposals). An independent program committee assesses the proposals and selects the actual conference talks.<br/>
